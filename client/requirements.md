## Packages
framer-motion | Complex animations for the spinner wheel and page transitions
canvas-confetti | Celebration effects when a team wins
@types/canvas-confetti | Types for confetti
clsx | Utility for constructing className strings conditionally
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind classes efficiently

## Notes
WebSocket connection required at /ws for real-time game state updates
Tailwind config needs extension for custom game colors (teams: red/blue)
Font usage: 'Press Start 2P' or similar display font for game headers would be nice, but I'll stick to Google Fonts available via index.css
